Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Example

    For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false.

    There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

    For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

    You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

---------------------------------------------------------------

boolean almostIncreasingSequence(int[] sequence) {
    int count = 0;
    if (sequence[1] <= sequence[0]) {
        count++;
    } 
    if (sequence.length > 2 && sequence[sequence.length-1] <= sequence[sequence.length-2]){
        count++;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i < sequence.length-1; i++) {      
        if (sequence[i] <= sequence[i-1]) {
            count++;
            if (sequence[i] <= sequence [i-2] && sequence[i+1] <= sequence[i-1]) {
                  return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return count <= 1;
 }
